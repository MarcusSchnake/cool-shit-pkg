Welcome to cool-shit-pkg if you are here: You know something. What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. Why is there no ipsum for Robert De Niro quotes? Your prayers are answered. Amen
